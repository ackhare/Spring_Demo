This is very basic example of implementing BeanPostProcessor, which prints a bean name
 before and after initialization
of any bean. You can implement more complex logic before and after instantiating
a bean because you have access on bean
object inside both the post processor methods.



Output

/*

log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
BeforeInitialization : helloWorld

AfterInitialization : helloWorld
Your Message : Hello World!
