1)@Configuration is generally used with Bean in one file but with @component USED IN A SEPERATE FILE
2)Injecting interface refrence and dynamic polymorphism important example
package com.springCore.javaConfig;
3)Through @configuration and @ Beran you can satisfy dependencvies see -->
package com.springCore.javaConfigs.javaBasedConfiguration; and complete dependency

com.springCore.javaConfigs.JavaBasedConfigToInjectMultipleConfig;

4)easy to do constructor injection through @bean

5)The Resource annotation marks a resource that is needed by the application.
  This annotation may be applied to an  application component class, or to fields or methods of the
  component class.  When the annotation is applied to a
   todo )field or method, the container will inject an instance( mucch like @Bean)
   of the requested resource into the application component
   todo when the component is initialized.

    If the annotation is
     applied to the component class, the annotation declares a
     resource that the application will look up at runtime. <p>
